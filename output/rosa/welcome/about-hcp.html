<p class="p">Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes (HCP) offers a reduced-cost solution to create a managed ROSA cluster with a focus on efficiency. You can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.</p>

<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key features of ROSA with HCP</h2>



<ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">ROSA with HCP requires a minimum of only two nodes, making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises.</li>

    <li class="li">The underlying control plane infrastructure is fully managed. Control plane components, such as the API server and etcd database, are hosted in a Red Hat-owned AWS account.</li>
    
    <li class="li">Provisioning time is approximately 10 minutes.</li>
    
    <li class="li">Customers can upgrade the control plane and machine pools separately, which means they do not have to shut down the entire cluster during upgrades.</li>
